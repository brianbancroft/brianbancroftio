Based off of Gatsby Starter Blog. Procrastination from actually writing copy.

## Why Gatsby?
- I haven't touched react in about a year, and wanted to go back into it with the lessons learned from building EmberJS apps.
- I spend too much time in Ruby and not enough time with CSS/JS
- I don't do enough with GraphQL. Separating the default queries into two different packages was an interesting experiment (which worked)

## What remains
- [x] Image layout for blog posts
- [ ] Try to integrate the [Responsive Grid of Hexagons](https://github.com/web-tiki/responsive-grid-of-hexagons) into the portfolio page
- [x] Bottom linking in the blog/portfolio (issue fixed, hiding content for simplicity)
    - [x] IF no newer article, go to twitter to see me rant?
    - [x] If no newer portfolio piece, go to stumbleupon
    - [x] Link to portfolio/blog in centre of bottom-links.
- [ ] Clean up all stateless components.
- [ ] Chose a different typeface for the following:
    - [ ] Blog Posts
    - [ ] Portfolio Pieces
    - [ ] Remainder of the site



## Running
- First, get the packages -> `yarn`
- Run in develop -> `gatsby develop`
- Build -> `gatsby build`
- Serve -> `gatsby serve`
