<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>dmission time: I did a development bootcamp. The following is the final project which I conducted with <a href="http://kristincheverie.com/">Kristin Cheverie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajit-chandi-14507273/">Ajit Chandi</a>.</p>

The concept of this app was threefold:

  1. We needed a scraper that would take pull data from the Parliament of Canada website to populate this site,
  2. We needed a easy-to-access site that would allow everyone to know more about their elected officials; and,
  3. We needed a separate back-end app which would be the API that makes this site fast and agile.

  I advised on the first, offered troubleshooting on the second for mapping, and developped the third.
