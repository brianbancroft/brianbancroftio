Why
---

Condobees was my first contract. I wasn't in charge of the high-level design but instead a large portion of its implementation. This project was done under the supervision of [David Krett](http://w2d.co/), who also caried out a large portion of the back-end.

- A User interface that allows individuals to look through pre-construction condos
- Users could also download a procedurally-generated document
- Contact information from the document would be used to make futher contact to see whether user is interested in that property

This project had me work in the following areas:

  1. Front-end development with VueJS, Including Router and Resource.
  2. Back-end development. Create controllers, connect them up.
  3. Mapping. Markers, styles and data-driven popups using Mapbox GL
  4. Javascript and ES6 Interaction
  5. PostGIS.

This was my first crack at Rails and VueJS, and needs a significant design overhaul. I feel that the UI is decent, but there are elements that could stand to be so much better. Since then, I've learned how to carry out e2e testing using selenium, as well as creating better tests in Minispec, RSpec (my preferred choice), and Mocha.
