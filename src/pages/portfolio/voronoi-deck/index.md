## Why

Deck GL is a newish tool introduced by Uber. Its big draw is that it's really powerful at visualizing big datasets. This is my first crack at using the tool.

## The Code.

You can find the code [here](https://github.com/brianbancroft/deck-gl-example)

## The Result

[This is bare-bones, and more of a proof-of-concept.](http://deck-voronoi.bancroft.io/)

## My Thoughts

* The API is a bit different to handle than most other libraries
* There is solid GeoJSON support, at first glance
* Things take a bit of tweaking, unless you want rendering issues...
* This has potential
* I really like the idea of using this in concert with [kepler.gl](http://kepler.gl/#/)

Kepler offers a fantastic means of prototyping, allowing dataviz people to focus just on the visualization aspect, while the developers can focus on the building, and tooling.

This is just my first thoughts at this time, however.
