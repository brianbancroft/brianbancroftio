Why?
---
One of my first projects at CareerJSM was to build a Resume Builder, so that customers who weren't expert with Office, or at building Resumes could build their resumes from scratch with on-screen guidance in a manner which would help career coaches have to spend much less time on guiding those who were on the hunt for a new job.


How
---
- Use a JS library to insert content directly into XML docs for Word, Word 2003+
- Use a rails library and 3rd party api to feed HTML and Style directly into a PDF view
- Use jsonresume's agreed syntax as a starting point for the data structure for a job-seeker's resume
- Build on that.

### The Stack:
- Json Resume
- Ruby on Rails
- Ember JS
- A really-awesome UX/UI/Designer ( TODO: Get link for Charles Wu)

### The procedure
- Build API
- Build sample page for loading, creating, or deleting resumes
- Build sample page for loading, selecring resume styles
- Build sample page for non-iterable content (introductions, summary of the job-seeker)
- Build a sample view for iterable content (Introductions)
- Take the HTML/CSS prototype provided by the awesome UX/UI dude, and make that into reality
- Iterate.
