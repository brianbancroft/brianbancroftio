This is a quick stylistic redo of the Elections Canada riding map for the Mississauga-Lakeshroe EDA map. I initially saw the original map as useful, but not aesthetically pleasing.

There are a few details here I dislike. First, there are the colour choices. The use of red overrides everything else in precidence. You're not paying attention to the labels, or the street names. Just the boundaries of the ridings. All of them, as opposed to the one we're interested in. Next, the labelling. There are parts where the riding name labels are being obscured by other lines, such as roads. This is bad. The scale is also insufficient for all the space. There is an _entire Great Lake_ to the right of the scale, which is unused. This is the same as the North Arrow, which is over some roads, when it could be chilling over some unused blank space on the map.

The style reminds me a lot of the bare-bones Canvec style used in the Canadian topographic maps, with just a few special overlays. For Mississauga-Lakeshore, we can do better...

## So What Did I Do?

So I made a few key decisions. First, I removed many of the labels. Unless you are dealing with arteries that feed into the riding, within the riding, or bordering the riding, they were of no importance. Same goes for the rivers. I know that not having the Etobicoke Creek (on the right) might be a little bit controversial, but I believe this is justified, as no residential suburb branches cross the creek at all.

Take a look at the roads as well. I try to use negative space here (white on grey), as it allows me a lot more flexibility with my labels. Nowhere are any of the characters in the adjacent ridings or the roads obscured by roads or river.

Colour is also important for me. I only use it for Lake Ontario, and sparringly, lest it take away from the ridings. Everything else is in grayscale: No black. Just varying shades of grey. These shades help denote the visual heiarchy of the map so that it's clear that the most important thing is the riding's label, followed by the area where the riding occupies, followed by the labels of the surrounding ridings.

Last, but not least is the details: The projection, the scale, the authour. A scale bar you can use to compare long distances, and a north arrow obscured by _nothing_.
