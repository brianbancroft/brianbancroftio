## Why

While working as a stand-in at the University of Ottawa's Geographic, Statistical and Govermental Center at the library, there was a problem that was presented to us: We had a series of scanned legacy topographic maps, and we wanted to present them in a manner that was suitable for the consumption.

This script took a series of tif's, a indexing spreadsheet, and outputted a series of compressed, orthorecitified geotiffs as well as an index shapefile which could be use to reference and share each orthorectified geotiff.

### Techniques

* Using cursors
* Georeferencing
* Using third-party libraries to read Excel and similar docs
* Messing with strings

## Lessons Observed

This is where I learned that I enjoyed programming, and wanted to pursue it as a career. Since then, I started to automate anything I could at my following jobs.

Since then, I've become skilled in the following areas:

* Git. My commit messages no longer suck
* Naming and Algorithms
  * I'm still a bit sloppy when it comes to fire-and-forget scripts...
  * ...Unless I require to share them with the team.
  * But I regularly use Pylint and Prettier.
