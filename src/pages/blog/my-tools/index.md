It's been about two years since I retooled as a web-developer from working in the mapping field, in the field. Since then, I've been finding myself bouncing between front-end client-side development (making things connect on web pages, and making them look pretty), back-end development (Building the interaction between web pages and small servers, designing and kitting up the databases), and some orchestration (which I'm still awful at)

## Hardware

My main piece of kit is a 2015 Macbook Pro 15". As a rough field-working type, it's _vitally_ important that the device can do all my coding and map work, and still be able to manage [dust]() (link to article about new mbp kb's go here). While Apple has continued to build

## Software

I only get to make great things when I step on the shoulders of giants. When I build new software, it's because of the contributions of dozens who came before me, and decided that a particular project was worth their time. The following is a list and explanation of the things which I use to make good stuff, now:

### Command Line and its Plugins

#### Iterm2

Iterm is a command line program for MacOS known for its customizability. I especially like it for it's toggle show/hide shortcut, which is directly linked to my workflow.

#### OH-MY-ZSH

Oh my zsh allows me to pimp my command line so that it's more friendly, and affords me a lot more information than before...

#### Powerlevel9k

Powerlevel9k is my preferred plugin that deals with the visualizations in the command line.

#### Version Management in Ruby and Node

I use RVM and NVM. Truth is many software platforms I work on or experiment with use different versions of Ruby or Node, and being able to switch between versions seamlessly is very important.

#### ... And in Python...

Anaconda. Get it, figure it out, love it. There are so many dark and twisting paths in Python package management, and this seems to be the best solution on the block.

#### Package Management in Node

I still use NPM. I don't have a strong argument for using either NPM or Yarn, and think that a competition between the two services is the best thing ever for the other.

### Code Management

### Text Editors

There was once a day where the fully-featured _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE) was king. But a lot of beginners found it to be too many things to too many people. Eventually, people started once again to prefer applications that were just plain ascii text editors. Then they added _plugins_ that resulted in a stone-soup of IDE's where the community brought the functionality to the table of a plain text editor. Some of the more popular ones I've run into in my career have been Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++ and a few others...

...In my work, I use a combination of VIM and VSCode. Eventually, it's my intent to become vim-only, but that's going to be sometime in the future.

#### VSCode

Microsoft recently built this thing. It has plugins. It's completely open-source and free and the best.

The following is a list of my plugins:

#### VIM. Why?

The following is a list of my plugins:

### GIS Analysis

#### QGISs

### Design

#### Sketch

#### Affinity Photo and Designer. Much easier to deal with than a subscription for the time being, and the price was decent when I purchased them. When I become more advanced, I might look at Adobe. Not now.
