I have a bit I need to write about in the technical sphere. Hopefully I can offer it here!


I decided I wanted to specialize in web development in support of mapping applications awhile back. But before I did that, I wanted to get a certificate that illustrates my competence in Esri software: _The Esri ArcGIS Desktop Associate Certification_. I've since writen a series of articles about it on GoGeomatics, an interview, and I've talked about it in the local chapter of GoGeomatics.

### Articles:
* [Why am I going to take it?](http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/esri-technical-certification-why-am-i-going-to-take-it.htm)
* [How did I prepare for it?](http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/part-2-preparing-for-the-esri-desktop-associate-exam.htm)
* [Okay, it wasn't so tough...]((http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/esri-technical-associate-certification-how-i-passed-the-test.htm))
* [A post-cert interview](http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/jessi-mielke-esris-certification-manager-chats-about-the-esri-technical-certification-program.htm)
